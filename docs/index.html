He was a politician for the Democrats, the Republicans and the Labor parties. He was mostly focused that the American government was going in the right direction. He fought in World War 1. He fought for various civil rights movements, helpings Greek-Americans, African-Americans and Jews.</p><p>He also wrote a somewhat well known poem called "My Creed."</p><br><h2>My Creed</h2><p>I do not choose to be a common man. It is my right to be uncommon—if I can. I seek opportunity—not security. I do not wish to be a kept citizen, humbled and dulled by having the state look after me. I want to take the calculated risk; to dream and to build, to fail and to succeed. I refuse to barter incentive for a dole. I prefer the challenges of life to the guaranteed existence; the thrill of fulfillment to the stale calm of utopia. I will not trade freedom for beneficence nor my dignity for a handout. I will never cower before any master nor bend to any threat. It is my heritage to stand erect, proud and unafraid; to think and act for myself, enjoy the benefit of my creations, and to face the world boldly and say, this I have done. All this is what it means to be an American.</p><br><h3>He is a very intresting person and I welcome you to learn more about him <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Alfange" target="_blank"><b>here</b></a>.</h3></div></div><script>!function(e,t,a,n,c,o){e.GoogleAnalyticsObject=n,e[n]||(e[n]=function(){(e[n].q=e[n].q||[]).push(arguments)}),e[n].l=+new Date,c=t.createElement(a),o=t.getElementsByTagName(a)[0],c.src="https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js",o.parentNode.insertBefore(c,o)}(window,document,"script","ga"),ga("create","UA-XXXXX-X"),ga("send","pageview")</script><script src="scripts/vendor.js"></script><script src="scripts/plugins.js"></script><script src="scripts/main.js"></script></body></html>
